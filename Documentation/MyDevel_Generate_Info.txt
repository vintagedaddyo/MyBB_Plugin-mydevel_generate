This plugin is for development purposes only so I wouldn't recommend using this on a live site.

This plugin generates random content and users to use during the development process of a plugin or theme instead of creating dummy content and users by hand.


Users:
- configurable amount
- configurable random group per user
- random avatar per user
- standard password: devel123


Threads:
- configurable amount
- configurable random forum or sub-forum
- random user per thread
- random post icon per thread


Posts:
- configurable amount
- configurable random forum or sub-forum
- random user per post
- random post icon per post
